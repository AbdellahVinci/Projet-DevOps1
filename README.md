## Project Description

This project is based on one of the most well-known katas to practice testing strategies. The task is to transform a digital time into a Berlin clock format. The Berlin clock is composed of several lines of light bulbs that represent different parts of the time:



## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm test` to execute the Jasmine tests.




### Key Files

- Spec/berlinClock.spec.js : Contains Jasmine tests for the Berlin Clock. In this file, we define unit tests to verify that the methods in the `App.js` file work correctly. The tests ensure that the lamps are correctly turned on/off for each part of the clock (seconds, hours, minutes).
  
- Src/App.js: The main implementation of the Berlin Clock logic. This file contains the `Main` class with various methods that implement the functionality of the Berlin Clock.
